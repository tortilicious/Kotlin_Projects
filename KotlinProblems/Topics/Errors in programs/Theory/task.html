<p>Suppose, you're writing a Kotlin program. Different errors may occur during its compilation or execution. We will divide all possible errors into two groups: <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11559" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a compile-time error is an issue that prevents a program from successfully compiling. | These errors can include typos, incorrect method invocations, or mismatched variable declarations. Compile-time errors are different from run-time errors, which occur after the program has compiled and is running. Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from running at all. Modern IDEs with static code analyzers can help programmers spot and correct compile-time errors before attempting to compile the program.

There are two main subtypes of run-time errors: logic errors and unhandled exceptions. Logic errors occur when a program produces an incorrect result due to incorrect code, such as outputting hi! instead of the expected hello!. Unhandled exceptions include errors such as division by zero, file not found, and others.">run-time errors</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let's look at cases where errors occur and see how to avoid them.</p>
<h5 id="compile-time-errors">Compile-time errors</h5>
<p>Compile-time errors are errors that prevent a program compiling. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p>syntax errors: incorrect keyword, typo, missing parenthesis or brace;</p></li><li><p>incorrect imported package name;</p></li><li><p>non-existing method invocation.</p></li></ul>
<p>Consider the following example of compile-time errors. The following program should output the string <strong>"Hello!" </strong>but it does not compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main(args: Aray&lt;String&gt;) {
    printn("Hello!")
}</code></pre>
<p>There are two errors in this program:</p>
<ul><li><p>a typo in the class name <code class="language-kotlin">Array</code>;</p></li><li><p>an incorrect name of the function <code class="language-kotlin">println</code>.</p></li></ul>
<p>If you fix these mistakes, it will be possible to compile the program.</p>
<p>To avoid such errors, programmers use modern IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11559" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a static code analyzer is a tool that helps to spot compile-time errors before the program compilation. | Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from running at all.

A static code analyzer in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can help programmers to spot and correct compile-time errors before attempting to compile the program. This can save time and effort in the debugging process. Additionally, modern IDEs with static code analyzers can highlight warnings about more complex errors and weak places in your code, as well as provide tips on how to improve the code.">static code analyzer</a>. This tool allows programmers to identify compile-time errors before the compilation.

<p>Over time, you will write code that contains fewer or even no compile-time errors.</p>
<h5 id="run-time-errors">Run-time errors</h5>
<p>Run-time errors (also known as "bugs") are errors that occur when the program is running. Run-time errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even stop the execution.</p>
<p>There are two subtypes of run-time errors:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11559" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a logic error is a type of run-time error that occurs when a program produces an incorrect or wrong result due to the code not being written correctly. | Unlike compile-time errors, logic errors do not prevent the program from running, but instead cause it to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect output. A common example of a logic error is when a program outputs hi! instead of the expected hello!. Logic errors can be difficult to detect and correct, as they do not produce clear error messages and may require careful debugging, code review, and automatic testing to identify.">logic errors</a></strong> â€“ when a program produces a wrong result because the code is not correct (for example, instead of <strong>"Hello!"</strong>, your program outputs <strong>"Hi!"</strong>);</p></li><li><p><strong>unhandled exceptions</strong> like division by zero, not found files, and other unexpected cases.</p></li></ul>
<p>We will learn how to handle exceptional events (exceptions) in further lessons.</p>
<p>Avoiding run-time errors is a more difficult task than avoiding compile-time errors. If your program compiles successfully, there are no guarantees that it does not have bugs. There are different strategies to find such errors:</p>
<ul><li><p>to <strong>debug</strong> your program;</p></li><li><p>to write<strong> automatic tests</strong> for your program;</p></li><li><p>to use <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11559" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a code review is the process of examining and evaluating code written by a developer to ensure it meets quality, style, and functionality standards before it is merged into the main codebase. | This practice is essential in a collaborative development environment as it helps maintain consistency, catch errors, and promote knowledge sharing among team members. In Kotlin, code reviews can be facilitated by using documentation tools like KDoc and Dokka, which generate API documentation from comments in the source code, making it easier for reviewers to understand the code's purpose and behavior.">code review</a> </strong>practice as part of the development process. In general, this practice stands for a case when one or more developers visually inspect the source code of a program.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<ul><li><p>Compile-time errors happen when a program fails to compile. They include typos and incorrect method invocation.</p></li><li><p>Static code analyzers in IDEs help to spot compile-time errors before program compilation.</p></li><li><p>Run-time errors, or bugs, occur after compilation when a program is running.
