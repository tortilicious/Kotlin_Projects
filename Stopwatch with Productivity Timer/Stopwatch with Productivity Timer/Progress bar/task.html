<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>To make the application more visual, let's add a special graphical feature â€” an indeterminate progress bar that helps users understand the current application status. When the stopwatch is running, the progress bar will appear, meaning that the application is currently in work mode.</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Objectives</strong></p><p>Add a progress bar with the <code class="java">id</code> attribute <code class="java">progressBar</code>. It should appear when the stopwatch starts and disappear on reset. The progress bar should change color every second. The choice of color does not matter: you can set a new random color on each iteration or switch between two colors of your choice.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>Here is an example of what your updated application can look like.</p><p style="text-align: center"><picture><img alt="android stopwatch progress bar" height="400" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8d1ab455-34c4-4b65-a472-8d6c25a9d1ff/" width="189"/></picture></p>
